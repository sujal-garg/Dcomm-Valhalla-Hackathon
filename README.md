## Idea 
A metaverse is a fancy way of describing a digital world where people can interact with each other and computer-generated objects in 3D. Imagine a virtual playground or game where you can talk to people, play games, and explore a whole new world.

The proposed solution is a new way of learning that uses a combination of virtual reality and mixed reality technology to create an immersive learning experience. This means you can attend classes, do your homework, and take exams all in a virtual classroom that looks and feels like a real one. You can even get help from your mentors and classmates in real time, just like in a physical classroom.

The classroom is set up in a way that's fun and interactive, with different features and tools to help you learn. For example, you might have access to digital textbooks, videos, or simulations that make learning more engaging and exciting. You can also interact with computer-generated objects or avatars to help you understand concepts better.

Overall, the MR classroom education portal is an innovative way of learning that's designed to help students engage and learn more effectively. It's a glimpse into the future of education, where technology can help us learn in ways we never thoughtÂ possible.
